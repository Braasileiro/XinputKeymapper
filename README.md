# XinputKeymapper
A program to map letters or strings using a XInput control.

My first program in C# and first firm contact with object-oriented programming.

The program basically works as a typist texts using the buttons of a XInput device.
It may be useful to map buttons on a game that does not support control or configure default strings to be entered by the XInput device.

# Installing
The program has no installer, just open the executable "XinputKeymapper.exe" and follow the instructions.

NOTE: Do not forget to plug in control before opening the program!

# Requeriments
* Windows 7 or higher
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6
* A XInput based control (XBOX 360, XBOX One, etc.)

# Usage
The program runs in the system notification area, click the right button on the icon and you have the following options:

* `About XinputKeymapper`: Information about the program.
* `TypeSpeed Control`: Control buttons typing mode.
* `Manual Configuration`: Opens the configuration file for manual editing.
* `Configuration Wizard`: Reset the setting and re-opens the first run assistant.
* `Exit`: Exit the program.

All configuration items are self explanatory. In TypeSpeed Control move the mouse pointer over the options to read the explanation of them.
